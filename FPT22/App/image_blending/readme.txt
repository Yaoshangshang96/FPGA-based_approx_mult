Application: Image Blending

Software: Matlab R2019b, Vivado 2018.3

1.Use img2bin.mlx to transform two images into binary file. (default size is 512*512*1)

2.Use pixel_mult.v to multply corresponding  pixels in Vivado.

3.Use bin2img.mlx to transform binary file into image.

4.Use compare.mlx to compare the difference between exact multiplier and approximate multipliers.


Step 1,3,4 are in Matlab, Step 2 is in Vivado.
